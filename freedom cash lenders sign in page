In most cases, payday loans are granted for relatively small amounts, often $500 or less, with the average borrower obtaining a payday loan for about $375. In some cases, payday loans can be made for larger amounts.

To get a payday loan, borrowers are asked to write a personal check for the amount of the debt plus any finance fees. If the loan is not paid back on time, the lender will deposit the check to recoup their funds. Some lenders may ask for authorization to electronically deduct the funds from your bank account instead of requiring that you provide a personal check.

Payday loans generally do not involve credit checks and your ability to pay back the debt while also continuing to pay your everyday expenses is typically not considered as part of the application process.
